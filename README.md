# Project Overview

## 1. Bartek_Borkowski_PPDp_Latin_Square:

This file includes solutions to the Latin Square problem using:
- **CPLEX ILOG**
- **Simulated Annealing** (heuristic)
- **Tabu Search** (heuristic)

Additionally, it includes a report on the problem, discussing the optimization problem and algorithms, and recommending the best method to use, along with important implementation notes. *(Report in Polish)*

## 2. Bartek_Borkowski_PPDp_Kakuro:

This file contains the solution to the Kakuro problem using:
- **CPLEX ILOG**

It also includes a report on the problem, the optimization process, and algorithms, with recommendations on which method to use, along with important implementation notes. *(Report in Polish)*

## 3. Problems Solved:
A file (`ult.mod`) containing solutions to various problems, such as:
- **Euclidian Point Assignment** (with variations like costs, designated points, etc.)
- **Optimal Job Scheduling** (with variations like deadlines, start times, multiple machines, etc.)
- **Shortest Path Optimization**
- **Traveling Salesman Problem** (In Polish we call it: Komiwoja≈ºer (co-me-voyager), and I love it :) )
- **Hungarian Algorithm**
- **Searching in a Set**
- **Filling a Rectangle with Smaller Rectangles**
- **Knapsack Problem**
