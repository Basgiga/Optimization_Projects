3. Problems Solved:
  a file (ult.mod) that consists of solutions to multiple problems such as:
   euclidian point assignation (with some variations like costs, designated points etc etc)
   
   Optimal job scheduling (with some variations like deadlines, start time, multiple machines etc etc)
   
   Shortest path Optimization
   
   Traveling salesman problem (in poland we call it Komiwoja≈ºer and i love it (Komiwo) :) )
   
   Hungarian Algorithm

   Searching in a Set

   Filling a rectangle with little rectangles

   Knapsack problem

4. Little optimization projects i needed to conquer the Tribal Wars game :)).
